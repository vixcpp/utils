/**
 * @file VIX_SCOPE_GUARD_HPP
 * @brief Minimal scope guard (RAII) to run a callback at scope exit.
 *
 * `ScopeGuard::ScopeGuard` executes a user-provided callable when the guard
 * goes out of scope, unless explicitly dismissed via `dismiss()`.
 *
 * - **RAII**: guarantees cleanup even on exceptions or early returns
 * - **Movable**: transfer ownership safely; non-copyable
 * - **Noexcept dtor**: destructor never throws
 * - **Exception-safety**: callback exceptions are swallowed inside the guard
 *   (they are NOT propagated at scope exit)
 *
 * ### Example
 * @code
 * using ScopeGuard::make_scope_guard;
 *
 * void example() {
 *   bool committed = false;
 *   auto g = make_scope_guard([&]{
 *     if (!committed) rollback();  // runs on scope exit unless dismissed
 *   });
 *
 *   do_work();
 *   committed = true;
 *   commit();
 *   g.dismiss(); // prevent rollback()
 * } // if not dismissed, callback executes here
 * @endcode
